Linear Regression


See [readme.pdf](readme.pdf).

We have provided you with two sample reports: [`problem1_writeup_sample.pdf`](problem1_writeup_sample.pdf) and [`problem2_writeup_sample.pdf`](problem2_writeup_sample.pdf). Your final writeup submissions must be modelled after them. You are also required to submit your code in the files specified in the readme.pdf

Happy coding :)
